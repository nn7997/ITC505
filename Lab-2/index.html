	<h2>Abstract
	</h2>
	<p>"This paper surveys the field of Augmented Reality, in which 3-D virtual objects are integrated into a 3-D real environment in real time. It describes the medical, manufacturing, visualization, path planning, entertainment and military applications that have been explored. This paper describes the characteristics of Augmented Reality systems, including a detailed discussion of the tradeoffs between optical and video blending approaches. Registration and sensing errors are two of the biggest problems in building effective Augmented Reality systems, so this paper summarizes current efforts to overcome these problems. Future directions and areas requiring further research are discussed. This survey provides a starting point for anyone interested in researching or using Augmented Reality.

	<h2>Definition
	</h2>
	<p>"Augmented Reality (AR) is a variation of Virtual Environments (VE), or Virtual Reality as it is more commonly called. VE technologies completely immerse a user inside a synthetic environment. While immersed, the user cannot see the real world around him. In contrast, AR allows the user to see the real world, with virtual objects superimposed upon or composited with the real world. Therefore, AR supplements reality, rather than completely replacing it. Ideally, it would appear to the user that the virtual and real objects coexisted in the same space, similar to the effects achieved in the film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" Figure 1 shows an example of what this might look like. It shows a real desk with a real phone. Inside this room are also a virtual lamp and two virtual chairs. Note that the objects are combined in 3-D, so that the virtual lamp covers the real table, and the real table covers parts of the two virtual chairs. AR can be thought of as the "middle ground" between VE (completely synthetic) and telepresence (completely real) [Milgram94a] [Milgram94b].
hard surface virtually is fairly difficult, but it is easy to do in reality. Then the tactile effectors in the glove can augment the feel of the desk, perhaps making it feel rough in certain spots. This capability might be useful in some applications, such as providing an additional cue that a virtual object is at a particular location on a real desk [Wellner93].

	<h2>Historical development of augmented reality
	</h2>
	<p>"The historical development of augmented reality (AR) is a fascinating journey that spans several decades. AR technology has evolved from theoretical concepts to practical applications in various industries. The roots of AR can be traced back to the 1960s when computer scientists and researchers began exploring the concept of overlaying digital information onto the real world.
The 2000s saw significant advancements in tracking technologies, which are crucial for AR. Marker-based and markerless tracking systems improved the accuracy and robustness of AR applications.
ARToolKit, an open-source tracking library developed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, made it easier for developers to create AR applications.The introduction of smartphones with cameras and sensors in the late 2000s paved the way for mobile AR. Apps like Layar and Wikitude allowed users to overlay digital information on their smartphone screens based on GPS and camera data.
Companies like Magic Leap, Microsoft (with HoloLens), and Facebook (now Meta) began developing AR headsets for consumer use.
PokÃƒÂ©mon GO, released in 2016, brought AR into the mainstream by allowing users to capture virtual creatures in the real world using their smartphones.

	<h2>Future Trends and Research Directions

	</h2>
	<p>"Considering the future of augmented reality (AR) is vital for remaining at the cutting edge of this technology and fully harnessing its capabilities. Anticipated developments include more compact, lighter, and comfortable AR hardware, with a focus on enhancing the design and user experience of AR glasses and headsets. Additionally, AI and machine learning will play an increasingly significant role in AR, supporting functions such as object recognition, natural language processing, and personalized content delivery. The emergence of AR cloud infrastructure will enable persistent AR content in physical spaces, fostering shared and collaborative experiences. These evolving trends and research directions in AR necessitate collaboration among researchers, industry experts, and policymakers to shape the technology's future while addressing challenges and ethical considerations.
